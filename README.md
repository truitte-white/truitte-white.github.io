### Overview

For the final project, you'll be designing and building a web app of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of JavaScript and awhat you've learned in this course. The result will be a web app that you can add to your portfolio.

There are Three routes possible for this project:

1) JS Game - Any game using HTML, CSS, and DOM Manipulation with JS (Trivia, Flash Cards, Hangman...)
2) API Call - Make a call to an existing API database and render your information on screen
3) API Call with an Express Server - Create your own local server with express, then run an Axios call on the front end to pull and render your data 

### Technical Requirements

- HTML, CSS, and JS files
- At least 2 user interactive features (text input + buttons) 
- Clean code with consistent indentation, code commenting and use of proper and consistent naming conventions


### Necessary Deliverables

* A **production ready web application**, A user interactive web page
* A  **new git repository hosted on Github** where codebase is maintained.
* A 5 minute **presentation** including 3 technical hurdles, 2 new things you learned, Q&A.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Think of a problem in the world, or even in your personal life, and apply what you've learned to build an application that can help solve the issue.
- Research different social media APIs (i.e. twitter) and see what kind of information you can use from them.
- Look at different online [video games](http://phaser.io/examples) for inspiration.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as tab indentation, DRYness, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
